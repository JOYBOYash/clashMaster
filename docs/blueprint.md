## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep, earthy brown (#A0522D) to evoke the rustic, base-building essence of the game. Brown represents stability and the foundations you build.
- Background color: Very light tan (#F5F5DC) that's easy on the eyes and reminiscent of parchment or strategy maps, allowing key information to pop.
- Accent color: Rich gold (#FFD700) to highlight upgrade timers and crucial resources, aligning with the game's core reward system. 
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif, to give an elegant, intellectual, contemporary feel. This adds sophistication, perfect for presenting strategic information.
- Use icons that clearly represent building types and resources, mirroring the style of Clash of Clans but optimized for clarity in a widget format.
- Employ a grid layout that organizes upgrades by base (main/builder) and completion time, emphasizing critical path upgrades.
- Incorporate smooth, subtle progress animations to visually represent the countdown to upgrade completion, enhancing user engagement.
